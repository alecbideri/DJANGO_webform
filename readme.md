Welcome to my Django app! Here's how you can set it up on your local machine:

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/alecbideri/DJANGO_webform.git

3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```
  env\Scripts\activate
  ```

4. Navigate to the project directory:
cd mod

5. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Apply migrations:
python manage.py migrate

7. Run the development server:
